    "title": "BINSAI: Integrated IoT-Based Smart Waste Management System using Non-Contact Ultrasonic Sensing and Ammonia Detection",
    "description": "BINSAI (Bin Intelligence Sensor and Internet) is an IoT-based research project designed to optimize urban waste management. The system utilizes ESP32, HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors for non-contact volume monitoring, and MQ-135 sensors for ammonia gas detection (organic waste decomposition). Integrated with GPS NEO-6M and SIM800L for real-time telemetry and geolocation, the data is visualized via the Blynk mobile platform to support Smart City initiatives in Yogyakarta.",
