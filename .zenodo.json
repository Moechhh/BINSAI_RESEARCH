    "title": "BINSAI: Development of a Non-Contact Distance Sensor-Based Waste Bin Monitoring System and Internet of Things (IoT) Node Integrated with the Blynk Mobile Application to Support Smart Waste Management in the City of Yogyakarta",
    "description": "BINSAI (Bin Intelligence Sensor and Internet) is an IoT-based smart waste monitoring system developed to address the waste management crisis in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The system integrates ESP32 microcontroller with HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors for non-contact volume monitoring and MQ-135 gas sensors for ammonia detection (indicating organic waste decomposition). With integrated GPS NEO-6M for geolocation and SIM800L GSM module for redundant communication, the system provides real-time telemetry visualized through the Blynk mobile platform. This research validates a modular, scalable solution achieving 99.46% volumetric accuracy and 100% notification reliability, contributing to smart city infrastructure development and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).",
